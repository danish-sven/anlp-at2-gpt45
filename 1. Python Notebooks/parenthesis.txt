Example:

Original: Hi Amy (student), how you doing? [(
Original 2: Hi Amy, how you doing? [(
Corrected 1: Hi Amy, how (are) you doing? [(
Corrected 2: Hi Amy, how are you doing? [(
Corrected 3: Hi Amy (student), how are you doing? [(
Corrected 4: Hi Amy, how (are is supposed to be here) you doing? [(

Parenthesis () or Brackets []

Step 1: Remove any words inside () that match inside Original AND Corrected
Original: Hi Amy (student), how you doing? [(
Corrected3: Hi Amy (student), how are you doing? [(

Solution: 
-Find the words inside parenthesis for each row.
If parenthesis with words exists in Original AND Corrected:       
    If the words are the same,                                    [Corrected 3]
        Then we delete the content and ()
    If the words are not the same,                                [Corrected 1]
        Then remove the entire row
If parethesis with words exists in Original but NOT Corrected:    [Corrected 2]
    Then, delete the content and ()
If parenthesis with words exists in Corrected but not Original:   
    If there is only one word inside the corrected (),             [Original 2, Corrected 1]
        Then, delete () and keep the word
    But If, there are more than one word inside corrected (),      [Original 2, Corrected 4]
        Then, delete entire row

(Must be last step)
If there are any remaining [](), 
    Then delete []() but leave the sentence
